# Rainbow 6: Siege Recon Drone using Arduino

***Disclaimer: I have used multiple sources to make this project; it is merely a how-to as this project seems to not be documented clearly.***

#### Credits

- For the drone's 3d printed body, I found [this repo](https://github.com/Jangberry/Drone-rainbow-six) by @Jangberry. The specific files used are gone into in detail in this repo below. 
- For the drone code, I adapted a script [I found on CircuitBest](https://circuitbest.com/how-to-make-bluetooth-controlled-car-using-arduino/) into a two-wheeled variant to fit this drone.
- I used the app "Arduino Car" on the Google Play Store to RC the drone using bluetooth.

#### Components needed

- Access to a 3D printer
- 300g-ish of Black PLA (or you could spray paint, but not recommended)
- A computer
- An android to control the drone
- An Arduino microcontroller (I recommend the nano for size and price)
- Two DC motors
- Two Mecanum wheels (coloured / sprayed black)
- L298N Motor Driver
- HC-05 Bluetooth PCB
- Jumper wires (M-M, M-F, F-F)
- Toggle switch
- 18650 2 Slot battery holder
- 18650 Rechargeable Batteries
